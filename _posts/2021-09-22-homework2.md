Specification: I am coding all my app using Kotlin. So I took the tutorial path for Kotlin learner!

* **Things I've learned in lesson2_3:**

1.	I learned the basic step of creating an implicit intent filter for apps as well as activating an activity using intent. The android system matches the content of an implicit Intent and the Intent filters of any activities and let the users pick which app they want to achieve the activity on. I also found a bunch of android intent we can use to activate android built-in activity such as taking a picture.
1.	Since Iâ€™m doing this java path course using Kotlin, I learned how to convert java code to Kotlin with a default converter embedded in android studio. There are a lot of syntax and token differences between Kotlin and Java; however, the functions of each language pretty much work the same way when it comes to app development. After doing some research, I found that Kotlin is 100% compatible with the JVM which explains why this is the case.


* **lesson2_3 Homework**

Question 1: 
We use new Intent (String action) to create an implicit Intent to launch a camera app. 

Question 2: 
When I create an implicit Intent object, all of the above is true. Don't specify the specific Activity or other component to launch. Add an Intent action or Intent categories (or both). Resolve the Intent with the system before calling startActivity() or startActivityforResult().

Question 3:
I use Intent takePicture = new Intent (MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE) to take a picture with a camera app.

* **Things I've learned in lesson 4:**
1.	I learned the concept of activity cycle for an app which begins when the activity is created and ends when the activity is destroyed. When an activity is started, it follows the path of onCreate() -> onStart() -> onPause(). Then depends on what actions users have such as getting a phone call or locking their screen, activity lifecycle will switch to different state to maintain user data and to save power.
1.	We can override each state in the Activity class to add behavior that occurs when your activity transit to another state. In this lab, we used logcat to output sentences on log by calling Log.i() in each state override method. In the future, we can use logcat to debug our program. In addition to logcat, we also implemented timber class which acts the same way as the logcat but better because it helps avoid showing logs in a release version of the app.
