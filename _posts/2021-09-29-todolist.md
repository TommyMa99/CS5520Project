Specification: Due to ID verification issue using international passport, I have to postpone my date for submitting my app onto the app store

**Summarize**: I've learned how to learn Kotlin app design through tons of youtube video and stackflow. LOL. Yeah, the journey to build my first app is a tough one.
I created three activities that does add item, edit item and main screen interface. And connected them with intent that carry bundle(In my case UID of each item class). As for storing data, I choosed to use Firebase database management system to store all the user input into a real-time databse. Using ID of each item in the database, I'm able to make data available to all the classes and make to-do-list editting very easy. I also created a user interface in the main screen that allows user to edit, add, and check as complete. In the activity to edit or add task, I designed a spinner that allows the users to choose from a variety of tags. I also created a edit box that is enabled by clicking on the reminder button. I will be refining my app to make it look more appealing to my users by designing a better-looking interface. The user interface right now is very straight forward with a textview followed by edit text. I will also be editting the interaction window for each task so that users are able to see important property related to it such as deadline and tag. I will also be introducing an intent to alarm activity on user's phone if user choose to set up a reminder. I also need to add an appealing app logo and more interesting interaction button on my app. My priority for now is to figure out a way to publish my app on the app store with no issue of ID verification.
