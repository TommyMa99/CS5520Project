**Update: Due to policy problem with the "Appealing to children" feature, the review for To-Do-App version 1 wasn't approved.
I reconfigured everything that is not consistent with Google console's privacy policy and updated the app bundle for version 
2 of my to-do-app. I'll keep update on the reviewing process here. I've also uploaded my to-do-app version 2 .apk/app bundle on github.
