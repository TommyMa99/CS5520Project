* **Things I've learned in lesson1_1:**
1.	Iâ€™ve learned how to set up a basic Kotlin android app program from scratch including downloading Android studio and setting up the versions of minimum SDK we are using. As for coding for android app, we can choose Kotlin and java. Kotlin and Java can be interpreted to each other automatically from android studio.

1.	I also leaned how each of the folder in the app file is related to different functions of the app. And they work together to create a stable and reasonable structure for the app. App folder holds all code and resources for the app. Res folder holds static content used in the app such as images, text strings, screen layout. The manifests folder contains files that provides essential information about your app to the android system. 

1.	One interesting feature I learned is to use the emulator on android studio to simulate the running condition of the app built. I learned how to choose from a variety of phone modules where I want to run my app on. And the way emulator is built is very practical in a way that different scenarios such as turn the screen 90 degree are all included in the emulator.
