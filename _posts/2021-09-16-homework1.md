* **Things I've learned in lesson1_1:**
1.	I’ve learned how to set up a basic Kotlin android app program from scratch including downloading Android studio and setting up the versions of minimum SDK we are using. As for coding for android app, we can choose Kotlin and java. Kotlin and Java can be interpreted to each other automatically from android studio.
1.	I also leaned how each of the folder in the app file is related to different functions of the app. And they work together to create a stable and reasonable structure for the app. App folder holds all code and resources for the app. Res folder holds static content used in the app such as images, text strings, screen layout. The manifests folder contains files that provides essential information about your app to the android system. 
1.	One interesting feature I learned is to use the emulator on android studio to simulate the running condition of the app built. I learned how to choose from a variety of phone modules where I want to run my app on. And the way emulator is built is very practical in a way that different scenarios such as turn the screen 90 degree are all included in the emulator.

* **Things I've learned in lesson1_2:**
1.	I learned how to create basic interaction unit such as a toast and how to see changes after each step by looking at the design from activity main. First, we need to define the resources needed for the activities and give it an ID; then we set up special conditions that will trigger these activities. Finally, the activity is executed in the main activities. 
1.	I learned that coding for an app is like writing a basic java program. Everything we code need to be defined somewhere in the program. Strings should not be hardcoded as my peers won’t be able to understand it; so, we use string resources to pre-define the strings we will be using in string.xml. 
1.	To set up the connection between the view in the layout and kotlin code, I need to get a reference to the view object. First, we assign an ID to the view in the layout, then we use the findViewById() method to finalize the connection. 


* **lesson1_2 Homework**
1.	setContentView() method on an Activity inflates the app's layout and makes its views available as objects
1.	android:layout_width=”wrap_content” is used to set the width of a view so that it adjusts to fit the content

* **Things I've learned in lesson1_3:**
1.	The most important lesson this lecture taught me is to add images to our app and use them to interact with users. Res plays the key role in this function. Images are placed into res first for linking through main activities. The activity main.xml file would reference these pictures in the res folder; and main activity would display these referenced images onto the screen.
1.	Images used in the app are vector drawable. They are XML file that define the color and shape of an image. All the .jpeg, PNG image file we’ve seem are bitmap image. Vector drawable images are much smaller in size and doesn’t lose quality after scaling. However, vector drawable can only be supported by API 21 onwards.
 
* **lesson1_3 Homework**
1.	tools: src attribute indicates a source image that should be used only in Android Studio
1.	setImageResource() changes the image resource for an Image View in Kotlin code
1.	lateinit keyword in a variable declaration indicates the variable will be initialized later. I promise!
1.	targetSdkVersion indicates the most recent API level your app has been tested with
An import line in your code that start with android means the class is part of the Android Jetpack libraries

* **Things I've learned in lesson1_4:**
1.	From this lesson, I learned some useful resources I could use when developing android app. Developer.android.com is the first source I would go to as that is the official android developer documentation. I can also use android developer YouTube channel and official android blog to get help for android app related problem. Stack overflow is also a great source we can go to when we are stuck on a bug or a problem.
1.	Android Studio provides us with built-in resources such as a variety of templates we can use for our App activity. These templates offer working code for common use cases. There are many samples app available for us on google samples. We can use these sample app as a starting point for our app. It is also something we can refer to when we run into a specific function related problem.
